\section{Introduction}
Testing is vital for software quality. Our IMS (https://github.com/NikhilChari/IMS.git) underwent unit, integration, and user acceptance testing.

\section{Testing Methodology}
- Unit Tests: Using [e.g., Jest] for individual modules.
- Integration Tests: Verifying API endpoints.
- Performance Tests: Load testing with [e.g., Apache JMeter].

Results showed [e.g., response times under 200ms].

\section{Evaluation Metrics}
Metrics include accuracy, scalability, and user feedback. A survey of [e.g., 50 users] rated usability at 4.5/5.

\section{Challenges and Improvements}
Issues like concurrency were addressed via optimizations.

\section{Conclusion}
Rigorous testing validates the system's robustness.
